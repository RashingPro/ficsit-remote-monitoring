You are always welcome to improve the project by adding your code. There are few rule you need to follow in order to get your PR merged.

1. Clearly describe all changes you made in PR
2. Don't touch build pipeline, configurations, dependencies and other stuff without clear reason
3. Use Prettier, ESLint, Knip and other included tools to keep project pretty, well-formated and clean
4. Don't even think about commiting `.vscode` (I will rip you apart)

If you have any questions - open an issue and we will discuss everything.
